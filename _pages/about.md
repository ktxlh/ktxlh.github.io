I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Cyrus Shahabi](https://infolab.usc.edu/Shahabi/index.html) in the [Information Laboratory (InfoLab)](https://infolab.usc.edu/). My research focuses on human mobility modeling and developing large spatio-temporal generative models.

I earned my Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2023, under the guidance of Professor [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) in the [SALT Lab](https://saltlab.stanford.edu/). During my time there, I worked on applying large language models to mental health.

Prior to that, I received my Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science, and in Data Science and Technology (double major) from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2021. I was honored to receive a Full University Scholarship valued at approximately US$98,000 and graduated with First-Class Honors. My undergraduate research, advised by Professor [Raymond Chi-Wing Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/), involved exploring fake news detection using heterogeneous Transformers and improving recommender systems.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I gained valuable industry experience through internships at [NVIDIA Deep Learning](https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning) and [Microsoft Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai) in 2022. Besides, I also participated in semester- and quarter-long study abroad programs at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), and [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2019 and 2020.

My journey into the world of coding began in 2014, and by 2016, I had completed my first research project on text classification at National Taiwan University, advised by Professor [Hsin-Hsi Chen](https://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/advisor.php).

When I'm not immersed in research (and perhaps course-credit hunting at different universities), I love to bake and spend time with my dog.
