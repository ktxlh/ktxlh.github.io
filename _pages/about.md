I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/Shahabi/index.html" target="_blank">Cyrus Shahabi</a> in the <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/" target="_blank">InfoLab</a> and awarded a Fellowship. My research focuses on human mobility modeling and developing large spatio-temporal generative models.

I earned my Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> in 2023, under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/" target="_blank">Diyi Yang</a> in the <a href="https://saltlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">SALT Lab</a>. During my time there, I worked on applying large language models to mental health.

Prior to that, I received my Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science, and in Data Science and Technology (double major) from the <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a> in 2021. I was honored to receive a Full University Scholarship valued at approximately US$98,000 and graduated with First-Class Honors. My undergraduate research, advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/" target="_blank">Raymond Chi-Wing Wong</a>, involved exploring fake news detection and improving recommender systems.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I gained valuable industry experience through internships at <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning" target="_blank">NVIDIA Deep Learning</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure AI</a> in 2022. Besides, I also participated in long-term study abroad programs at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>, <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University</a>, and <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a> in 2019 and 2020.

My journey into the world of coding began in 2014, and by 2016, I had completed my first research project on text classification at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/advisor.php" target="_blank">Hsin-Hsi Chen</a>.

When I'm not immersed in research, I love to bake and spend time with my dog.
